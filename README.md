# Introduction
Welcome to my word guessing game. I created this game as an assignment for the coding bootcamp I am enrolled in. 

# How It Works
The game is a simple hangman word guessing game, themed for NFL football teams. Each word is the name of an NFL team. Simply hit a letter or a number on the keyboard to guess that key. The user gets 12 guesses to correctly guess the word or they lose. If the user guesses the word before running out guesses remaining, they win the game.
